    Hello, fellow web browsing-capable beings! I am an Ecuadorian applied mathematician working on numerical methods for partial differential equations (PDEs). I am interested in hyperbolic, nonlinear, and dispersive PDEs and their applications in fluid dynamics, in particular water waves and tsunami modeling.
    I am currently a PhD student in the <a href="https://numerics.kaust.edu.sa/" target="_blank">Numerical Mathematics Group</a> at KAUST, under supervision of  <a href="https://www.davidketcheson.info/" target="_blank">Prof. David Ketcheson</a>.
