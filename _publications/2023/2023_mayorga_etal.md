  We consider an N-dimensional nonlinear Schrödinger equation $(P_{\varepsilon})$ with a positive Planck constant $\varepsilon>0$ and power nonlinearity $p>1$. We consider the finite case and critical frequency as described by Byeon and Wang, i.e., the continuous non-negative potential's zero level set is a singleton, around which it decays like a homogeneous positive function. In the limit $\varepsilon \to 0$, we denote the semiclassical limit problem by $(P_{\text{lim}})$. By a Ljusternik-Schnirelman scheme we get an infinite number of solutions for $(P_{\varepsilon})$ and  $(P_{\text{lim}})$, $v_{k,\varepsilon}$ and $w_k$, respectively. We prove, up to a scaling, that (a) $v_{k,\varepsilon}$ subconverges to $w_k$ pointwise and in Sobolev-like norm, (b) the energy of  $v_{k,\varepsilon}$ converges to that of $w_k$, and (c) $v_{k,\varepsilon}$ exponentially decays out of the zero level set of the potential.
