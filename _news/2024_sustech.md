title: "I spent three months in Shenzhen, China, as a participant in SUSTech ICM's Special Program on Numerical Methods for Nonlinear Hyperbolic PDEs. A lot of interesting talks and discussions about high-order discretizations and numerics for shallow water flows. Also, Shenzhen is an amazing city! China is a couple of decades in the future."
